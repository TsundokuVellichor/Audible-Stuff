Everyone says so. Except for my father; all he heard was Mother's sobs. Not of pain, but of joy, so he says. Other than that, the only verifiable fact about the day I was born is that an iceberg the size of Los Angeles broke free from the ice shelf, a few miles off the coast. Again, some would have me believe the fracture took place as I entered the world. But all that really matters, according to my parents, is that I, Solomon Ull Vincent, the first child born on Antarctica - the first and only Antarctican - was born on September 2, 1974.</p> <p>If only someone could have warned me that upon my return to the continent of my birth, 13 years later, I would be kidnapped, subjected to tortures beyond comprehension, and forced to fight...and kill. If only someone had hinted that I'd wind up struggling to survive in a subterranean world full of ancient warriors, strange creatures, and supernatural powers.</p> <p>Had I been warned, I might have lived a normal life. The human race might have remained safe. And the fate of the world might not rest on my shoulders. Had I been warned....</p> <p>This is my story - the tale of Solomon Ull Vincent - the last hunter.</p></span>","title":"The Last Hunter: Collected Edition","url":"https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Last-Hunter-Collected-Edition-Audiobook/B08R5FV95Q?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_&pf_rd_p=85df3330-9dc4-4a45-ae69-93cc2fc25ca4&pf_rd_r=6W2T72CAP1W6538TXB37"},{"asin":"1774247097","authors":[{"name":"Mrdojo","url":"https://www.audible.com/author/Mrdojo/B07JFQLM9H?ref=a_pd_Awaken_c1_author_1&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=B5FBRJRSD48P1JXYMHWP"}],"bookNumbers":null,"categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"https://www.audible.com/cat/Science-Fiction-Fantasy-Audiobooks/18580606011?ref=a_pd_Awaken_c1_bc&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=B5FBRJRSD48P1JXYMHWP"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"https://www.audible.com/cat/Science-Fiction-Fantasy/Fantasy-Audiobooks/18580607011?ref=a_pd_Awaken_c1_bc&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=B5FBRJRSD48P1JXYMHWP"}],"changesSinceAdded":false,"coverUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51vN9RgjexL._SL500_.jpg","dateAdded":null,"downloaded":true,"length":"21 hrs and 48 mins","moreLikeThis":null,"narrators":[{"name":"Joshua Story","url":"https://www.audible.com/search?searchNarrator=Joshua+Story&ref=a_pd_Awaken_c1_narrator_1&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=B5FBRJRSD48P1JXYMHWP"}],"ownRating":{"newStyleRating":null},"peopleAlsoBought":null,"progress":"1h 23m left","publisher":"Podium Audio","rating":"4.5","ratings":"(83 ratings)","releaseDate":"2020-12-29","series":null,"summary":"<span class=\"bc-text bc-color-secondary\"><p><b>What do you desire in exchange for your soul?

Her twin sister, Lacey, has always been the romantic who fantasized about glamour and royalty, fame and fortune. Yet it's Bex who seeks adventure at Oxford and finds herself living down the hall from Prince Nicholas, Great Britain's future king.

Handsome, charismatic, genius - his image is pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There's only one problem: Alex has a beef with the actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, US/British relations take a turn for the worse.</p> <p>Heads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: staging a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon, Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through?

Now I find it difficult to encapsulate the book in a short summary, but I felt the need to forewarn you, The Reader. Many of you have probably read my previous series, Mageborn, which is set two millennia after the events in this book, so you may have some misconceptions about what you’ll find here. </p> <p>Unlike Mageborn, this story encounters more adult issues. The main character does not always do the ‘right’ thing, and in fact, cannot be called a hero. Events conspire to darken his future and twist his morality, but his choices are his own. Most importantly, the story delves into some topics of a sensitive nature, particularly sexual abuse and violence, though there is nothing graphic in the telling. </p> <p>I didn’t set out to write a book about those things, but they came up as part of the course of this tale, and I couldn’t avoid them. Before allowing some of the situations in this book, before writing them, I sought advice from a number of friends; people who have confided in me over the years. Several of them have been through experiences that correlate to a surprising degree with some of the darker elements within this tale. </p> <p>Fortunately, they had much better outcomes, and in fact, I doubt any of them would condone the choices that the main character in this story makes. My main purpose in writing this foreword is to make sure that my audience understands that I don’t take the subject matter lightly. </p> <p>- Michael G.

Banks, and Orson Scott Card, <i>Fear the Sky</i> is a hard-hitting sci-fi thriller that will have you looking at the stars in a different way. </p> <p>In eleven years' time, a million members of an alien race will arrive at Earth. Years before they enter orbit, their approach will be announced by the flare of a thousand flames in the sky, their ships' huge engines burning hard to slow them from the vast speeds needed to cross interstellar space. These foreboding lights will shine in our night sky like new stars, getting ever brighter until they outshine even the sun, casting ominous shadows and banishing the night until they suddenly blink out. Their technology is vastly superior to ours, and they know they cannot possibly lose the coming conflict. But they, like us, have found no answer to the destructive force of the atom, and they have no intention of facing the onslaught of our primitive nuclear arsenal or the devastation it would wreak on the planet they crave. So they have flung out an advance party in front of them, hidden within one of the countless asteroids randomly roaming the void. They do not want us, they want our planet.

Now, in <i>Tongues of Serpents</i>, Naomi Novik is back, along with the dragon Temeraire and his rider and friend, Capt. Will Laurence. </p> <p>Convicted of treason despite their heroic defense against Napoleon’s invasion of England, Temeraire and Laurence—stripped of rank and standing—have been transported to the prison colony at New South Wales in distant Australia, where, it is hoped, they cannot further corrupt the British Aerial Corps with their dangerous notions of liberty for dragons. Temeraire and Laurence carry with them three dragon eggs intended to help establish a covert in the colony and destined to be handed over to such second-rate, undesirable officers as have been willing to accept so remote an assignment—including one former acquaintance, Captain Rankin, whose cruelty once cost a dragon its life. </p> <p>Nor is this the greatest difficulty that confronts the exiled dragon and rider: Instead of leaving behind all the political entanglements and corruptions of the war, Laurence and Temeraire have instead sailed into a hornet’s nest of fresh complications. For the colony at New South Wales has been thrown into turmoil after the overthrow of the military governor, one William Bligh—better known as Captain Bligh, late of HMS <i>Bounty</i>. Bligh wastes no time in attempting to enlist Temeraire and Laurence to restore him to office, while the upstart masters of the colony are equally determined that the new arrivals should not upset a balance of power precariously tipped in their favor.</p></span>","title":"Tongues of Serpents","url":"https://www.audible.com/pd/Tongues-of-Serpents-Audiobook/B00428AXWQ?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_&pf_rd_p=85df3330-9dc4-4a45-ae69-93cc2fc25ca4&pf_rd_r=H567HQQZNK89NRGJTY87"},{"asin":"B00QQQSMZM","authors":null,"bookNumbers":null,"categories":null,"changesSinceAdded":false,"coverUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51aW2u8eKkL._SL500_.jpg","dateAdded":null,"downloaded":true,"language":null,"length":"","moreLikeThis":null,"narrators":null,"ownRating":{"newStyleRating":null},"peopleAlsoBought":null,"progress":"1h 9m left","publisher":"","rating":"","ratings":"","releaseDate":null,"series":null,"summary":null,"title":"","url":"https://www.audible.com/pd/Christmas-Eve-1914-Audiobook/B00QQQSMZM?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_&pf_rd_p=85df3330-9dc4-4a45-ae69-93cc2fc25ca4&pf_rd_r=H567HQQZNK89NRGJTY87"},{"asin":"B07GJ5W4BG","authors":[{"name":"Rob Dircks","url":"https://www.audible.com/author/Rob-Dircks/B008QPRC5M?ref=a_pd_Youre-_c1_author_1&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=0A0NXXV1AM5C934J2EWB"}],"bookNumbers":null,"categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"https://www.audible.com/cat/Science-Fiction-Fantasy-Audiobooks/18580606011?ref=a_pd_Youre-_c1_bc&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=0A0NXXV1AM5C934J2EWB"},{"name":"Science Fiction","url":"https://www.audible.com/cat/Science-Fiction-Fantasy/Science-Fiction-Audiobooks/18580628011?ref=a_pd_Youre-_c1_bc&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=0A0NXXV1AM5C934J2EWB"}],"changesSinceAdded":false,"coverUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CQKYWMSaL._SL500_.jpg","dateAdded":null,"downloaded":true,"length":"11 hrs and 12 mins","moreLikeThis":null,"narrators":[{"name":"Khristine Hvam","url":"https://www.audible.com/search?searchNarrator=Khristine+Hvam&ref=a_pd_Youre-_c1_narrator_1&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=0A0NXXV1AM5C934J2EWB"}],"ownRating":{"newStyleRating":null},"peopleAlsoBought":null,"progress":"Finished","publisher":"Audible Originals","rating":"4.3","ratings":"(3,405 ratings)","releaseDate":"2018-11-13","series":null,"summary":"<span class=\"bc-text bc-color-secondary\"><p>Living and slaving in Fill City One, you get used to the smell.

What starts out as a seemingly innocuous pursuit quickly devolves into a nightmare when Alex discovers the true technological nature of the Florentine. Not just a lost treasure, it's something far more insidious: a weapon that could bring the developed world to its knees. Alex races through subterranean grottos, freezing morgues, and hidden cellars in the dark underbelly of Los Angeles, desperate to find the Florentine before it falls into the wrong hands. Because if nefarious forces find it first, there'll be nothing Alex - or anyone else - can do to prevent a catastrophic attack. </p></span>","title":"The Florentine Deception","url":"https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Florentine-Deception-Audiobook/B01959UJ6G?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_&pf_rd_p=85df3330-9dc4-4a45-ae69-93cc2fc25ca4&pf_rd_r=XKCY2WSTG7072AJB4X5C"},{"asin":"B07BTHWMFF","authors":[{"name":"Dakota Krout","url":"https://www.audible.com/author/Dakota-Krout/B01M2UQD35?ref=a_pd_Ritual_c1_author_1&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=MRXRVZQMXPBZRPST6EVW"}],"bookNumbers":[1],"categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"https://www.audible.com/cat/Science-Fiction-Fantasy-Audiobooks/18580606011?ref=a_pd_Ritual_c1_bc&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=MRXRVZQMXPBZRPST6EVW"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"https://www.audible.com/cat/Science-Fiction-Fantasy/Fantasy-Audiobooks/18580607011?ref=a_pd_Ritual_c1_bc&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=MRXRVZQMXPBZRPST6EVW"}],"changesSinceAdded":false,"coverUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gdghNyhCL._SL500_.jpg","dateAdded":null,"downloaded":true,"length":"12 hrs and 6 mins","moreLikeThis":null,"narrators":[{"name":"Vikas Adam","url":"https://www.audible.com/search?searchNarrator=Vikas+Adam&ref=a_pd_Ritual_c1_narrator_1&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=MRXRVZQMXPBZRPST6EVW"}],"ownRating":{"newStyleRating":null},"peopleAlsoBought":null,"progress":"Finished","publisher":"Tantor Audio","rating":"4.8","ratings":"(9,399 ratings)","releaseDate":"2018-05-15","series":[{"bookNumber":1,"name":"The Completionist Chronicles","url":"https://www.audible.com/series/The-Completionist-Chronicles-Audiobooks/B07FLTRQMM?ref=a_pd_Ritual_c1_series_1&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=MRXRVZQMXPBZRPST6EVW"}],"summary":"<span class=\"bc-text bc-color-secondary\"><p>The decision to start a new life is never an easy one, but for Joe the transition was far from figurative.

Well, sort of. Life on Artemis, the first and only city on the moon, is tough if you're not a rich tourist or an eccentric billionaire. So smuggling in the occasional harmless bit of contraband barely counts, right? Not when you've got debts to pay and your job as a porter barely covers the rent. </p> <p>Everything changes when Jazz sees the chance to commit the perfect crime, with a reward too lucrative to turn down. But pulling off the impossible is just the start of her problems, as she learns that she's stepped square into a conspiracy for control of Artemis itself - and that now her only chance at survival lies in a gambit even riskier than the first. </p> <p>Bringing to life Weir's brash, whip-smart protagonist is actress Rosario Dawson (Marvel's <i>The Defenders</i>, <i>Sin City</i>, <i>Death Proof</i>). With the breathless immediacy of one realizing they're one cracked helmet visor away from oblivion, Dawson deftly captures Jazz's first-person perspective – all while delivering sarcastic Weir-ian one-liners and cracking wise in the face of death. And with a cast of diverse characters from all walks of life calling Artemis home, Dawson tonally somersaults to voice Kenyan prime ministers, Ukrainian scientists, and Saudi welders.

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.</p> <p>It has been centuries since the fall of the 10 consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them and won by them.</p> <p>One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where 10 armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.</p> <p>Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.</p> <p>Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.</p> <p>The result of more than 10 years of planning, writing, and world-building, <i>The Way of Kings</i> is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.</p> <p>Speak again the ancient oaths:</p> <p>Life before death.</p> <p>Strength before weakness.</p> <p>Journey before destination.</p> <p>And return to men the Shards they once bore.</p> <p>The Knights Radiant must stand again.</p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson:</p> <p>The Cosmere</p> <p>The Stormlight Archive:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>The Way of Kings</i></li> <li><i>Words of Radiance</i></li> <li><i>Edgedancer (Novella)</i></li> <li><i>Oathbringer&nbsp;</i></li> </ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire</i></li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension</i></li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages</i></li> </ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law</i></li> <li><i>Shadows of Self</i></li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning</i></li> </ul> <p>Collection:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded</i></li> </ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris</i></li> <li><i>Warbreaker</i></li> </ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians</i></li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones</i></li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia</i></li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens</i></li> <li><i>The Dark Talent</i></li> </ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist</i></li> </ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners</i></li> <li><i>Steelheart</i></li> <li><i>Firefight</i></li> <li><i>Calamity&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p></span>","title":"The Way of Kings","url":"https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Way-of-Kings-Audiobook/B003ZWFO7E?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_&pf_rd_p=85df3330-9dc4-4a45-ae69-93cc2fc25ca4&pf_rd_r=MJSMC0GSN8S75YV6S1DE"},{"asin":"B00EEG2H48","authors":[{"name":"Tom Wood","url":"https://www.audible.com/author/Tom-Wood/B002RFD2P6?ref=a_pd_The-Ki_c1_author_1&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=HYRHF1AS5KC90N9A9VGK"}],"bookNumbers":[1],"categories":[{"name":"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","url":"https://www.audible.com/cat/Mystery-Thriller-Suspense-Audiobooks/18574597011?ref=a_pd_The-Ki_c1_bc&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=HYRHF1AS5KC90N9A9VGK"},{"name":"Thriller & Suspense","url":"https://www.audible.com/cat/Mystery-Thriller-Suspense/Thriller-Suspense-Audiobooks/18574621011?ref=a_pd_The-Ki_c1_bc&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=HYRHF1AS5KC90N9A9VGK"}],"changesSinceAdded":false,"coverUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51IkVDBAX6L._SL500_.jpg","dateAdded":null,"downloaded":true,"length":"15 hrs and 21 mins","moreLikeThis":null,"narrators":[{"name":"Rob Shapiro","url":"https://www.audible.com/search?searchNarrator=Rob+Shapiro&ref=a_pd_The-Ki_c1_narrator_1&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=HYRHF1AS5KC90N9A9VGK"}],"ownRating":{"newStyleRating":4},"peopleAlsoBought":null,"progress":"Finished","publisher":"Tantor Audio","rating":"4.3","ratings":"(3,323 ratings)","releaseDate":"2013-08-19","series":[{"bookNumber":1,"name":"Victor the Assassin","url":"https://www.audible.com/series/Victor-the-Assassin-Audiobooks/B00EKK76BW?ref=a_pd_The-Ki_c1_series_1&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=HYRHF1AS5KC90N9A9VGK"}],"summary":"<span class=\"bc-text bc-color-secondary\"><p>Forget James Bond.

The possible consequences for Parshendi and humans alike, indeed, for Roshar itself, are as dangerous as they are incalculable.&nbsp;</p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>The Cosmere</i></li> <li><i>The Stormlight Archive</i></li> <li><i>The Way of Kings</i></li> <li><i>Words of Radiance</i></li> <li><i>Edgedancer </i>(Novella)</li> <li><i>Oathbringer&nbsp;</i></li> </ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire</i></li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension</i></li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages</i></li> </ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law</i></li> <li><i>Shadows of Self</i></li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning</i></li> <li><i>Collection</i></li> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded</i></li> </ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris</i></li> <li><i>Warbreaker</i></li> </ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians</i></li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones</i></li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia</i></li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens</i></li> <li><i>The Dark Talent</i></li> </ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist</i></li> </ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners</i></li> <li><i>Steelheart</i></li> <li><i>Firefight</i></li> <li><i>Calamity </i></li> </ul></span>","title":"Words of Radiance","url":"https://www.audible.com/pd/Words-of-Radiance-Audiobook/B00HWF0MHW?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_&pf_rd_p=85df3330-9dc4-4a45-ae69-93cc2fc25ca4&pf_rd_r=MJSMC0GSN8S75YV6S1DE"},{"asin":"B004QISZN6","authors":[{"name":"Patrick Rothfuss","url":"https://www.audible.com/author/Patrick-Rothfuss/B001DAHXZQ?ref=a_pd_The-Wi_c1_author_1&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=RGEWWRYE4TN0VNHEDWZ1"}],"bookNumbers":[2],"categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"https://www.audible.com/cat/Literature-Fiction-Audiobooks/18574426011?ref=a_pd_The-Wi_c1_bc&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=RGEWWRYE4TN0VNHEDWZ1"},{"name":"Action & Adventure","url":"https://www.audible.com/cat/Literature-Fiction/Action-Adventure-Audiobooks/18574427011?ref=a_pd_The-Wi_c1_bc&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=RGEWWRYE4TN0VNHEDWZ1"}],"changesSinceAdded":false,"coverUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51f2XSzLauL._SL500_.jpg","dateAdded":null,"downloaded":true,"length":"42 hrs and 55 mins","moreLikeThis":null,"narrators":[{"name":"Nick Podehl","url":"https://www.audible.com/search?searchNarrator=Nick+Podehl&ref=a_pd_The-Wi_c1_narrator_1&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=RGEWWRYE4TN0VNHEDWZ1"}],"ownRating":{"newStyleRating":null},"peopleAlsoBought":null,"progress":0,"publisher":"Brilliance Audio","rating":"4.8","ratings":"(68,992 ratings)","releaseDate":"2011-03-03","series":[{"bookNumber":2,"name":"Kingkiller Chronicle","url":"https://www.audible.com/series/Kingkiller-Chronicle-Audiobooks/B005NATG0M?ref=a_pd_The-Wi_c1_series_1&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=RGEWWRYE4TN0VNHEDWZ1"}],"summary":"<span class=\"bc-text bc-color-secondary\"><p><b>Discover #1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b>-bestselling Patrick Rothfuss’ epic fantasy series, The Kingkiller Chronicle.</b></p> <p>“I just love the world of Patrick Rothfuss.” -Lin-Manuel Miranda</p> <p>“He’s bloody good, this Rothfuss guy.” -George R.

It will keep you reading well into the night.” (Vince Flynn)</p> <p>A <i>New York Times</i> reporter has drawn upon his experience covering the occupation in Iraq to write the most gripping and chillingly plausible thriller of the post-9/11 era. Alex Berenson’s debut novel of suspense, <i>The Faithful Spy</i>, is a sharp, explosive story that takes listeners inside the war on terror as fiction has never done before.&nbsp;</p> <p>John Wells is the only American CIA agent ever to penetrate al Qaeda. Since before the attacks in 2001, Wells has been hiding in the mountains of Pakistan, biding his time, building his cover. Now, on the orders of Omar Khadri - the malicious mastermind plotting more al Qaeda strikes on America - Wells is coming home. Neither Khadri nor Jennifer Exley, Wells’s superior at Langley, knows quite what to expect. For Wells has changed during his years in the mountains. He has become a Muslim. He finds the United States decadent and shallow.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet he hates al Qaeda and the way it uses Islam to justify its murderous assaults on innocents. He is a man alone, and the CIA - still reeling from its failure to predict 9/11 or find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq - does not know whether to trust him. Among his handlers at Langley, only Exley believes in him, and even she sometimes wonders. And so the agency freezes Wells out, preferring to rely on high-tech means for gathering intelligence. But as that strategy fails and Khadri moves closer to unleashing the most devastating terrorist attack in history, Wells and Exley must somehow find a way to stop him, with or without the government’s consent.&nbsp;</p> <p>From secret American military bases where suspects are held and “interrogated” to basement laboratories where al Qaeda’s scientists grow the deadliest of biological weapons, <i>The Faithful Spy</i> is a riveting and cautionary tale, as affecting in its personal stories as it is sophisticated in its political details. The first spy thriller to grapple squarely with the complexities and terrors of today’s world, this is a uniquely exciting and unnerving novel by an author who truly knows his territory.</p></span>","title":"The Faithful Spy","url":"https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Faithful-Spy-Audiobook/B002V8OG90?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_&pf_rd_p=85df3330-9dc4-4a45-ae69-93cc2fc25ca4&pf_rd_r=MJSMC0GSN8S75YV6S1DE"},{"asin":"B0044UOB2K","authors":[{"name":"Vince Flynn","url":"https://www.audible.com/author/Vince-Flynn/B000APHM1K?ref=a_pd_Americ_c1_author_1&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=JRJED3K854HPW8GW07WR"}],"bookNumbers":[1],"categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"https://www.audible.com/cat/Literature-Fiction-Audiobooks/18574426011?ref=a_pd_Americ_c1_bc&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=JRJED3K854HPW8GW07WR"},{"name":"Genre Fiction","url":"https://www.audible.com/cat/Literature-Fiction/Genre-Fiction-Audiobooks/18574456011?ref=a_pd_Americ_c1_bc&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=JRJED3K854HPW8GW07WR"}],"changesSinceAdded":false,"coverUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51RxBQyxQ1L._SL500_.jpg","dateAdded":null,"downloaded":true,"length":"11 hrs and 44 mins","moreLikeThis":null,"narrators":[{"name":"George Guidall","url":"https://www.audible.com/search?searchNarrator=George+Guidall&ref=a_pd_Americ_c1_narrator_1&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=JRJED3K854HPW8GW07WR"}],"ownRating":{"newStyleRating":null},"peopleAlsoBought":null,"progress":"7h 54m left","publisher":"Simon & Schuster Audio","rating":"4.5","ratings":"(17,661 ratings)","releaseDate":"2010-10-12","series":[{"bookNumber":1,"name":"Mitch Rapp","url":"https://www.audible.com/series/Mitch-Rapp-Audiobooks/B005NAT9YK?ref=a_pd_Americ_c1_series_1&pf_rd_p=8a2752a8-601f-4465-b227-7e95d7917c27&pf_rd_r=JRJED3K854HPW8GW07WR"}],"summary":"<span class=\"bc-text bc-color-secondary\"><p>Before he was considered a CIA superagent, before he was thought of as a terrorist's worst nightmare, and before he was both loathed and admired by the politicians on Capitol Hill, Mitch Rapp was a gifted college athlete without a care in the world...and then tragedy struck. </p> <p>Two decades of cutthroat partisan politics has left the CIA and the country in an increasingly vulnerable position.

And I had just lost my job. There was no hope, no money in my account, no work to be found. And then, just when I thought all hope was lost, I found an envelope in the mail. No return address. My name on the front, my address. Inside was a check, made out to me, in the amount of 10 thousand dollars. Enough to pay the bills and leave me some left over to live on until I found a job. Enough to let me focus on classes. There was no name on the check, just \"VRI Inc.\", and a post office box address for somewhere in the city. No hint of identity or reason for the check or anything. No mention of repayment, interest, nothing...except a single word, on the notes line: \"You\".

Ten thousand dollars, every month. A girl gets used to that, real quick. It let me pay the bills without going into debt. Let me keep my baby brother in school and Mom's hospice care paid for.

His ambitious, multi-volume epics (Mistborn, The Stormlight Archive) and his stellar continuation of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series have earned both critical acclaim and a substantial popular following. In <i>Legion</i>, a short, distinctly contemporary novella filled with suspense, humor, and an endless flow of invention, Sanderson revealed a startling new facet of his singular narrative talent. In the stunning sequel, <i>Legion: Skin Deep</i>, that talent is on full display. </p> <p>Stephen Leeds, AKA ''Legion',' is a man whose unique mental condition allows him to generate a multitude of personae: hallucinatory entities with a wide variety of personal characteristics and a vast array of highly specialized skills. As the new story begins, Leeds and his \"aspects\" are hired by I3 (Innovative Information Incorporated) to recover a corpse stolen from the local morgue. But there's a catch. The corpse is that of a pioneer in the field of experimental biotechnology, a man whose work concerned the use of the human body as a massive storage device. He may have embedded something in the cells of his now dead body. And that something might be dangerous... What follows is a visionary thriller about the potential uses of technology, the mysteries of the human personality, and the ancient human need to believe that death is not the end. <i>Legion: Skin Deep</i> is speculative fiction at its most highly developed.

His ambitious, multi-volume epics (<i>Mistborn, The Stormlight Archive</i>) and his stellar continuation of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series have earned both critical acclaim and a substantial popular following. In <i>Legion</i>, a distinctly contemporary novella filled with suspense, humor, and an endless flow of invention, Sanderson reveals a startling new facet of his singular narrative talent, read by Audie Award-winning narrator Oliver Wyman.</p> <p>Stephen Leeds, AKA 'Legion,' is a man whose unique mental condition allows him to generate a multitude of personae: hallucinatory entities with a wide variety of personal characteristics and a vast array of highly specialized skills. As the story begins, Leeds and his 'aspects' are drawn into the search for the missing Balubal Razon, inventor of a camera whose astonishing properties could alter our understanding of human history and change the very structure of society. The action ranges from the familiar environs of America to the ancient, divided city of Jerusalem. Along the way, Sanderson touches on a formidable assortment of complex questions: the nature of time, the mysteries of the human mind, the potential uses of technology, and the volatile connection between politics and faith.

That is until an old friend presents him with an irresistible mystery, one that Mike is uniquely qualified to solve. </p> <p>Far out in the California desert, a team of DARPA scientists has invented a device they affectionately call the Albuquerque Door. Using a cryptic computer equation and magnetic fields to \"fold\" dimensions, it shrinks distances so a traveler can travel hundreds of feet with a single step.

Sick at heart, he comes home, determined to kill no more.

But his first mission makes him wish he had stayed on the outs when a pair of Chinese agents try to take him down in Hong Kong. Normally the Chinese prefer to stay eyes-only on foreign agents. So why are they on such high alert? Court's high stakes hunt for answers takes him across Southeast Asia and leads to his old friend, Donald Fitzroy, who is being held hostage by the Chinese. Fitzroy was contracted to find Fan Jiang, a former member of an ultra-secret computer warfare unit responsible for testing China's own security systems. And it seems Fan may have been too good at his job - because China wants him dead. The first two kill teams Fitzroy sent to find Fan have disappeared, and the Chinese have decided to \"supervise\" the next operation. What they don't know is that Gentry's mission is to find Fan first and get whatever intel he has to the US.

A conspiracy beyond imagination. And a race to save humanity in its darkest hour. </p> <p>From A. G. Riddle, the worldwide best-selling author of <i>The Atlantis Gene</i> and <i>Departure</i>, comes a novel that will change everything you think you know about pandemics. </p> <p>A hundred miles north of Alaska, an American Coast Guard vessel discovers a sunken submarine at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean. It has no national identification and doesn't match the records of any known vessel. Deep within, researchers find evidence of a scientific experiment that will alter our very understanding of the human race. </p> <p>In Atlanta, Dr. Peyton Shaw is awakened by the phone call she has dreaded for years. As the CDC's leading epidemiologist, she's among the first responders to outbreaks around the world. It's a lonely and dangerous job, but it's her life - and she's good at it. This time she may have met her match. In Kenya, an Ebola-like pathogen has infected two Americans. One lies at death's door. With the clock ticking, Peyton assembles her team and joins personnel from the Kenyan Ministry of Health and the WHO. What they find in the remote village is beyond their worst fears. As she traces the origin of the pathogen, Peyton begins to believe that there is more to this outbreak - that it may be merely the opening act in a conspiracy with far-reaching consequences. </p> <p>In Berlin, Desmond Hughes awakens in a hotel room with no memory of how he got there or who he is. On the floor he finds a dead security guard from an international pharmaceutical company. His only clue leads him to Peyton Shaw - a woman who seems to know him but refuses to tell him how. With the police searching the city for him, Desmond desperately tries to piece together what happened to him. To his shock and horror, he learns that he may be involved in causing the outbreak - and could hold the only key to stopping it. </p> <p>As the pathogen spreads around the world, Peyton and Desmond race to unravel the conspiracy behind the pandemic - and uncover secrets some want to keep buried. </p></span>","title":"Pandemic","url":"https://www.audible.com/pd/Pandemic-Audiobook/B072NRMT8Q?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_&pf_rd_p=85df3330-9dc4-4a45-ae69-93cc2fc25ca4&pf_rd_r=995C8886JP6A7B95CV86"},{"asin":"B005R35BMW","authors":[{"name":"B.

After all, he's not one of the handful of lucky lottery winners scheduled for rescue.
